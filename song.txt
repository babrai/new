When it's missing then you want it more
It isn't right
Turning, turning out the door
And back to this
Leave it like it was before
And let me out
Must've been the end of the story

Giving it all, giving it all away
You're gonna wake up someone
Well study it all
The wings, the crowd, your face
You're gonna end up like one

Well, trouble at home
Travel the way you say
"The road don't like me"
Travel away
Travel it all away
"The road's gonna end on me"
